                  Championing a Thriving Cashless Economy As the world witnesses the
                  emergence of an alternative digital economy, going cashless has
                  become the next step in the evolution of global finance and money.
                  The Network by Centurion is a community that fully supports this
                  evolution.

                The Network by Centurion is growing every day. When a given
                country reaches a sufficient level of local members, the company
                establishes support offices to keep sharing opportunities and
                possibilities to partners. From there, we build further new
                markets to grow our Network community. Now, The Network is
                comprised of more than 118,000 registered accounts from over 180
                countries, all across 6 continents of the world.

                The Compensation Plan offers eight different commissions.
                Premiums and bonuses are paid for DSV Package (Digital Shopping
                Voucher) purchases made by the community. Through a very modern
                administration and invoicing programme, sales commissions are
                recorded in real time and credited directly to partners’ various
                accounts. Network partners enjoy the flexibility to decide on
                how to use their DSV, from redeeming DUC, exchanging for premium
                Ducatus Merchandise, innovative health products and more.

                wealth. The Network Management team guides our partners to find
                a healthy, economic, personal and future-oriented balance in the
                digital world. Through knowledge, we aim to enhance and empower

                in need. Through Ducatus Charity, partners can provide financial
                support to chosen charity organisations. It is also open for

                they champion and donate funds to aid the less fortunate. This
                shared goodwill creates a bond that transcends monetary gains.
